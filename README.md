Functional Calculator Web Application
This project is aimed at creating a functional calculator web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The calculator should be capable of performing basic arithmetic operations while providing a user-friendly interface.


Visually appealing calculator interface using HTML and CSS.
Grid-based layout including buttons for numbers, decimal point, arithmetic operators, equal sign, and clear button.
Responsive design that displays well on different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, and desktop).
JavaScript logic to handle user interactions and perform calculations.
Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Allows input via both buttons and keyboard.
Displays entered numbers, current operation, and final result.
Clear button to reset the calculator.
Error handling for scenarios like division by zero.
